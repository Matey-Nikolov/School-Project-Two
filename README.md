# School-Project-Two
This is a robotics project. In this project, a temperature sensor and an ice undercolor were used. The function of this project is through the LED bar, according to how many degrees it is, to light accordingly.
<p><p/>

White - if the temperature is lower than 20 degrees, green - from 20 to 26 degrees, red - from 26 upwards. The LED display shows the current temperature. The only way to turn on the color indicator is serial communication. We have to type the keyword "on" or "ON". The project is made for fun and to show the capabilities of the Arduino board.

Used codes - these are the codes used to make my own.

Used libraries:
https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED, 
https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal

Used materials: 

arduino, LED strip (model WS2801), LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), temperature sensor.
